# Exploring Meta-T Tetris data from Lindstedt and Gray (2015; 2019)
Exploratory analysis of experimental tetris data set collected using the Meta-T tetris framework developed by Lindstedt and Gray (2015; 2019)

#### Usage:

- run dim_reduction.ipynb to collapse behavioural and game-state variables into four factors that describe tetris performance - this also generates csv for inferential stats. / modelling.
- exploring_performance.ipynb contains analyses to explore performance differences between top and bottom scorers, among other things.
- HMMs.ipynb is a WIP - we attempt to identify internal states that govern tetris performance by fitting Hidden Markov Models to players' individual games.
